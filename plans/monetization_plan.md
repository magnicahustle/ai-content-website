# Monetization Plan: Pay-Per-Click Advertising (Google AdSense)

## Objective
To generate passive income from AI-generated content with minimal human intervention by leveraging Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising, primarily through Google AdSense.

## Strategy Overview
The core strategy involves creating a simple website to host the AI-generated articles. Google AdSense will be integrated into this website to display relevant advertisements. Revenue will be generated each time a user clicks on an ad.

## Why Google AdSense?
*   **Low Effort:** Once set up, AdSense is largely automated. Google handles ad placement, targeting, and payment processing.
*   **Scalability:** As more content is generated and published, the potential for increased traffic and ad impressions grows, leading to higher earnings.
*   **Accessibility:** Relatively easy to get started compared to other monetization methods.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Website Development (Agent Task)
1.  **Website Structure:** Develop a basic, clean, and mobile-responsive website. This will likely be a static site for simplicity and performance.
2.  **Content Integration:** Modify the `content_creator.py` agent to generate articles directly into HTML format, suitable for direct publishing on the website.
3.  **Navigation & Layout:** Implement basic navigation and a consistent layout for articles.

### Phase 2: AdSense Account Setup (User Task)
1.  **Account Creation:** The user will need to create a Google AdSense account. This is a manual process requiring personal information and agreement to Google's terms of service.
2.  **Site Verification:** Once the website is live, it will need to be submitted to AdSense for review and approval.
3.  **Ad Code Retrieval:** Upon approval, the user will retrieve the AdSense ad code snippet.

### Phase 3: Ad Integration & Deployment (Agent Task)
1.  **Code Integration:** Integrate the provided AdSense ad code into the website's templates.
2.  **Deployment:** Deploy the website to a suitable hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or a simple web server).
3.  **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor website traffic and AdSense performance.

## Success Metrics
*   Website traffic (page views, unique visitors)
*   AdSense earnings
*   Click-Through Rate (CTR) of ads

## Next Steps
The agent will proceed with Phase 1: Website Development. The user will be notified when their action is required for Phase 2: AdSense Account Setup.
